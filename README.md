# ツ Aim and objectives:
<p align="justify">In this section, when we select a shapefile containing points, we created a section that calculates the distance between all points, calculates the maximum and minimum distances, and creates a new shapefile (temporary file, not saved) and adds these calculations to the attributes.</p>

<p align="justify">In this section, when we select a shapefile containing multiple lines, we created a section that calculates the shortest length and actual length by taking the start and end values ​​of all lines as reference</p>

<p align="justify">In the last section, when we selected a shapefile containing polygons, we created a section that calculated the area of ​​all polygons in the file we selected.</p>

<p align="justify">Accessibility and layout are very important in improving GUI quality. The location of the buttons, the style and size of the texts and coloring are very important. Our priority should be that there are not too many buttons and that the buttons to be used should be easily understood.</p>

<p align="justify">While creating the GUI, I gave importance to the ease of the interface. The button we click to select the Input File should not take up a lot of space. The part showing the location of the file should be wide and it should show more clearly the location of the file we have selected. Additionally, in my research, I felt the need to add an additional part. Because when we select some shapefiles, we need to create a new layer, for example, a new shapefile created to show it as a line after calculating the distance between two points. and we need to run a function in this creation process, and we do this with the "Run" button. This is all I could do as a result of my research in past projects and on the web.</p>
